========

**Note**: This document is partially referenced from Sinon.JS. However, most usages and API are redesigned.

Sinon.PY is inspired by `Sinon.JS`_. Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for Python. No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework.

Overview

This document contains the entire Sinon.PY API documentation along with brief introductions and examples to the concepts Sinon implements.
